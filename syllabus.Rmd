## Basic information {#basicinfo}

* **Course title:** SDS 390 Topics in Statistical and Data Sciences - Ecological Forecasting
* **Communication:** All communication will take place via Slack.
    + You must have the [Slack Desktop or Mobile
    App](https://slack.com/downloads/){target="_blank"} installed, since it is
    too easy to miss messages when using the browser version.
    + After you've installed Slack, add the sds-390-2020-09.slack.com workspace.
* **Lectures:** Tue/Thu 9:20am - 10:35am Eastern
* **Pre-requisites:**
    1. SDS 192 Introduction to Data Science
    1. SDS/MTH 291 Multiple Regression
    1. The same pre-reqs as MTH 211 Linear Algebra, which is a required course for the SDS major:
        + MTH 112 Calculus II or 
        + MTH 111 Calculus I and MTH 153 Intro to Discrete Math



## Instructor work-life balance

* I will respond to Slack messages sent during the week within 24h. I will
respond to Slack messages sent during the weekend at my own discretion.
* If possible, please only Slack me with briefer and administrative questions; I
prefer having more substantive conversations over Zoom as it takes me less
energy to understand where you are at.
* I will do my best to return all grading as promptly as possible.

# Course Description & Objectives

**Official course description**: Ecologists are asked to respond to
unprecedented environmental challenges. How can they provide the best scientific
information about what will happen in the future? The goal of this seminar is to
bring together the concepts and tools needed to make ecology a more predictive
science. Topics include Bayesian calibration and the complexities of real-world
data; uncertainty quantification, partitioning, propagation, and analysis;
feedback from models to measurements; state-space models and data fusion;
iterative forecasting and the forecast cycle; and decision support. A
semester-long project will center on data from the [Smithsonian Conservation
Biology Institute (SCBI) forestry
reserve](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute){target="_blank"}.

**Course objectives and learning goals**: This semester you will:
