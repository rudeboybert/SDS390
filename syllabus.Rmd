## Basic information {#basicinfo}

* **Course title:** SDS 390 Topics in Statistical and Data Sciences - Ecological Forecasting
* **Communication:** All communication will take place via the
sds-390-2020-09.slack.com Slack workspace. You must have the [Slack Desktop or
Mobile App](https://slack.com/downloads/){target="_blank"} installed, since it
is too easy to miss messages when using the browser version.
* **Lectures:** Remote only Tue/Thu 9:20am - 10:35am Eastern
* **Pre-requisites:**
    1. SDS 192 Introduction to Data Science
    1. SDS/MTH 291 Multiple Regression
    1. The same pre-reqs as MTH 211 Linear Algebra, which is a required course for the SDS major:
        + MTH 112 Calculus II or 
        + MTH 111 Calculus I and MTH 153 Intro to Discrete Math



## Instructor work-life balance

* I will respond to Slack messages sent during the week within 24h. I will
respond to Slack messages sent during the weekend at my own discretion.
* If possible, please only Slack me with briefer and administrative questions; I
prefer having more substantive conversations over Zoom as it takes me less
energy to understand where you are at.
* I will do my best to return all grading as promptly as possible.

# Course Description & Objectives

**Official course description**: Ecologists are asked to respond to
unprecedented environmental challenges. How can they provide the best scientific
information about what will happen in the future? The goal of this seminar is to
bring together the concepts and tools needed to make ecology a more predictive
science. Topics include Bayesian calibration and the complexities of real-world
data; uncertainty quantification, partitioning, propagation, and analysis;
feedback from models to measurements; state-space models and data fusion;
iterative forecasting and the forecast cycle; and decision support. A
semester-long project will center on data from the [Smithsonian Conservation
Biology Institute (SCBI) forestry
reserve](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute){target="_blank"}.

**Course objectives and learning goals**: This semester you will:

1. Apply near-term iterative forecasting principles in an ecological setting.
1. "Learn how to learn" domain specific knowledge, in our case ecology.
1. Learn effective strategies for reading journal articles.
1. Collaborate on projects remotely using advanced GitHub tools: issue tracking,
branches, pull requests, code reviews, etc.
1. Create [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} dashboards that
provide "consumers of science" with tools to explore large datasets.

# Textbooks {#textbooks}

We'll be using the following two textbooks:

* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (online edition)](https://otexts.com/fpp2/){target="_blank"} by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos. 
* [Ecological Forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160573/ecological-forecasting){target="_blank"} by Dietze. 
You can find exercise code for each of the chapters in the [EcoForecast GitHub
Repo](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities){target="_blank"}

# Evaluation {#evaluation}

## Mini-Projects 50% {#miniprojects}

Over the course of the semester there will be several mini-projects that will
build up to the term project.

## Term Project 35% {#termproject}

There will be a term project involving analysis of these data sources:

1. Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) ForestGEO Data
[(GitHub)](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data){target="_blank"}
1. Michigan Big Woods research plot data [(Michigan Deep Blue
Data)](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/ht24wj48w?locale=en){target="_blank"}
1. Smith College MacLeish Field Station
[(smith.edu)](https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/sustainable-smith/macleish){target="_blank"}
and [(`macleish` R package)](https://github.com/beanumber/macleish){target="_blank"}

## Engagement 15% {#engagement}

This will be measured by a combination of

1. Your participation in synchronous Zoom meetings, in particular relating to journal articles.
1. Discussions on Slack.
1. Peer-evaluations of group work.

## Policies

TBD

# Academic Honor Code

All students are expected to adhere to the Smith College Academic Honor Code:

> Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the
principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and
submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are
part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which
depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of
information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.

In the case of a suspected violation, I will follow the [procedures for
faculty](https://www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/socialconduct/honorcode.php){target="_blank"}:

1. I will have a private discussion with the student first, where I will present
student with evidence of the infraction in question.
1. If an Academic Honor Board case is merited, I will give the student the
opportunity to report themselves first at <honorboard@smith.edu>.
1. I will then write to <honorboard@smith.edu> and to the Dean of the College
<docemail@smith.edu>.
1. The ultimate decision will then be in the hands of the Academic Honor Board.
