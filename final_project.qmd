# Final Project


I will have this cleaned up by Tue 11/14, then let students pick groups google form. Please reply in thread if you have questions or comments.

Todos:
- Put out google form for groups/individuaals
- Write out precise dates and expectations
- Difference in expectations between group and individual projects?
- Grading will be based on does student incorporate feedback:
- Research question is somewhat limited bc this is a forecasting course, but you will have choice of which visualizations to use, bc there will be a set limit of 4-5. 
- Loose guidelines as to what constitutes a single visualization
- Structure: Fill in Jupyter notebook
- Don’t bang head on wall finding data that has pre-conceived patterns, but it has to be protein’y enough to be able to apply methods we’ve learned

Criteria
Is presentation clean: do you use markdown, are axes and titles labeled, are images standalone
Does student adequately but also succinctly convey context of data and problem?
Does student apply methods and code learned in PS to their own data in python?
Does student go above and beyond just describing the what of results and try to provide insight going above and beyond

Video:
- Not expecting complete polish
- 4-5min recorded zoom. Be sure to test for 10s first
- Narrate the markdown
