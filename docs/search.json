It keeps feeling like I’m doing a small portion of a data analysis. I find myself”going through the motions” and feeling it is tedious because I don’t think I’m really comprehending the importance of each step.”\n“Making stupid mistakes on the syntax and kind of confused about the difference between [] and . when calling an attribute”\n“Worried I won’t retain my understanding”\n“I prefer this over problems sets because it gives an instant response and allow me to improve my work before finally submitting it”\n\nMain tip: “Optimal frustration”"
