# Part 1: Evals data

Which of the two following models from [ModernDive Chapter 6.1](https://moderndive.com/6-multiple-regression.html#model4) are you inclined to select?

1. The interaction model
1. The parallel slopes model

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", title = "Interaction model") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 <- ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", title = "Interaction model") +
  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", title = "Parallel slopes model") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
p1 + p2
```

# Part 2: Interspecies Competition

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS390/static/images/competition_neighborhood.png")
```

```{r}
# Compute growth ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Load 2008 census data and join additional species data
census_2008 <- bw_census_2008 %>%
  left_join(bw_species, by = "sp")

# Load 2014 census data and filter out resprouts
census_2014 <- bw_census_2014 %>%
  filter(!str_detect(codes, "R"))

bw_growth <-
  # Merge both censuses and compute growth:
  compute_growth(census_2008, census_2014, id = "treeID") %>%
  # Convert data frame to sf object
  st_as_sf(coords = c("gx", "gy")) %>%
  # Clean variables
  select(ID = treeID, species = trait_group, growth, geometry)
```

Plot all trees in Michigan Big Woods plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = bw_growth) +
  geom_sf(aes(col = species), size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "All trees in Michigan Big Woods site")
```

Plot only the maples:

```{r}
ggplot(data = bw_growth %>% filter(species == "maple")) +
  geom_sf(aes(col = species), size = 0.5)+
  labs(title = "All maple trees in Michigan Big Woods site")
```

Also recall our notion of competition: for each focal tree we compute the sum of the competitor biomass of all trees within 7.5m. Load this data for each maple tree on the site. 

```{r}
maples <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS390/static/data/maples.csv")

# Only first 6 rows:
head(maples)
```

Which of the two following models for the interspecies effect of competition on the growth $y$ of maples are you inclined to select?

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
y &=& \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{dbh}}\cdot \text{dbh} + \beta_{\text{total_bm}}\cdot \text{total_bm} + \epsilon\\
y &=& \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{dbh}}\cdot \text{dbh} + \beta_{\text{evergreen_bm}}\cdot \text{evergreen_bm} + \beta_{\text{maple_bm}}\cdot \text{maple_bm} + \beta_{\text{misc_bm}}\cdot \text{misc_bm}\\
&& + \beta_{\text{oak}}\cdot \text{oak} + \beta_{\text{short_tree}}\cdot \text{short_tree} + \beta_{\text{shrub}}\cdot \text{shrub} + \epsilon
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

where 

1. $\text{dbh}$ is the "starting" DBH in 2008
1. $\text{bm}$ is "biomass" as estimated by the [basal area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_area).

## b) What factors influence growth?
