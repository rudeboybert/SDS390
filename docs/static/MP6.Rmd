# Eastern Hemlock Data

For this MP we'll be using data from Marney Pratt's BIO 131 class.^[Many thanks Marney!] Here is the data's [codebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVz_0ivC6Wpa5bNSG4JoOUp7iQfZJVgOXrfkXwyPeas/edit){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
hemlocks <- 
  "https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS390/static/data/hemlocks_pratt.csv" %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  # Drop those in Fitzgerald Lake & MacLeish, keeping only those on Smith campus
  filter(location == "SMC")
```

# Part 1: Biomass

1. How much Eastern Hemlock [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)){target="_blank"} is there in the portion of Paradise Pond featured in the Lec13 video? Be mindful of the units. 
1. Plot and comment on the relationship between diameter at breast height and above ground biomass.

Hint: use the development version of the [`allodb`](https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb){target="_blank"} written by my collaborators at SCBI: Erika Gonzalez-Akre, Mauro Lepore, Camille Piponiot, and Kristina Anderson-Teixeira.

# Part 2: Model relationship between DBH and height

Assume that this set of `r nrow(hemlocks)` is a representative sample of ALL Eastern Hemlocks on Smith College campus, and thus any inferences/results based on this sample can *generalize* to all Eastern Hemlocks on Smith College campus.

1. Fit a model, any model, for $y$ = height of the tree using diameter at breast height.
1. A forest ecologist asks "How would you quantify the relationship between tree height and diameter at breast height for all Eastern Hemlocks on Smith College campus?" Respond to them.
1. Visualize this model. There are many ways to do this, but here is one way:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

# Fit model
mpg_model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

# Look at fitted values and residuals using broom::augment()
augment(mpg_model) %>% head()

# Visualize observed data with black points and fitted values with red line
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_line(data = augment(mpg_model), aes(x = hp, y = .fitted), col = "red")
```


```{r}

```
