## Class meeting time

1. Announcements
    1. More introductions: name/pronoun, year/major, city you're currently in, name a few things you will do this semester for self-care.
    1. Started scheduling office hours in [syllabus](syllabus.html).
    1. We'll be using the [3rd online edition of FPP](https://otexts.com/fpp3/){target="_blank"} (I originally linked to the 2nd edition).
1. Check in on [MP1](#MP1)
1. Set up our workspace for the semester:
    1. Open RStudio
    1. Create a new RStudio project called `SDS390`
    1. Create a new `.R` script or `.Rmd` and call it `lecture_notes`
    1. Copy the code for any lecture into `lecture_notes`. For today: the above `# Lec03 Code`
1. Breakout rooms: A designated group leader will create a Slack DM with all members, but not Albert. They will take notes and then speak on behalf of the group. Discuss
    1. What is the goal of analysis hinted in Video 1? Questions?
    1. Do you have questions about Video 2 on time series?
    1. Do you have any feedback/comments about lecture format?
    1. Questions about MP1?
1. [Link](https://smith.zoom.us/rec/share/msdCameUcJtJV4W6_TllvNOYGCYdU72iUSIFMPXxW0oF4zYv6G25uVGJdjHQ3BRb.MdQFuvpLLtgaxvUU){target="_blank"} to video recording.

## Class meeting time

1. "Chalk talk": Introduction to GitHub terminology. I encourage you to write along: [*I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.*](https://twitter.com/jack/status/369882367093002242){target="_blank"}
1. Demo of what you'll be doing for MP1. 
1. [Link](https://smith.zoom.us/rec/share/r1TRECCVTK1AST0fjikBWNFziM1id-VtREbZM2mLsuv_sS4N5NkKCqrzOqh76BiS.cj7NMRvilB29J2yz){target="_blank"} to video recording.



## For next week

### 1. Readings

The readings for next week are posted in the above Schedule Google Sheet. Anything below the orange line is still TBD.  

1. To access all journal articles from Smith Libraries, you will need to be logged into Smith's Virtual Private Network [(instructions on how to set this up)](https://www.smith.edu/its/tara/networking/vpn.html){target="_blank"}. 
1. Tips on reading. Take the *minimally viable product* approach. In other words, a completed imperfect reading is better than an incomplete "perfect" reading.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("static/images/MVP.png")
```

    
### 2. MP1 {#MP1}

Ask any questions in the `#mp1` channel on Slack.

**a) Data collection**

1. To the best of your abilities, replicate my DBH data collection in the video.
1. You will submit your answers in this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJ28eWWThINaXKWE2uvOFuDL2YiMVPheSa47ZRrtp8Q10W1Q/viewform){target="_blank"}.
1. You may need help identifying the tree's species. To this end, take a few photos of the tree and if possible the leaves. 


**b) First GitHub edits**

1. Create an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/){target="_blank"}, which you can think of as a social security number for research. Mine is [0000-0001-7824-306X](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7824-306X){target="_blank"}.
1. *Clone* the following *repo* *locally* onto your computer using RStudio: my *forked* copy of Prof. Ben Baumer's [`macleich` R package](https://github.com/rudeboybert/macleish){target="_blank"}. 
1. *Pull* the repo to update it with any changes.
1. Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file by adding yourself as a contributor like I did.
1. *Commit* your changes and then *push* them.
1. You may need to check out these [notes](https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS192/PS.html#1_github_component){target="_blank"} on getting started linking GitHub to RStudio.
