## Class meeeting time

1. "Chalk talk": Introduction to GitHub terminology. I encourage you to write along: [*I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.*](https://twitter.com/jack/status/369882367093002242){target="_blank"}
1. Demo of what you'll be doing for MP1. 
1. Link to recording to be posted here after lecture. All recordings will use the same password shared on Slack.


## For next week

### 1. Readings

The readings for next week are posted in the above Schedule Google Sheet. Anything below the orange line is still TBD.  

1. To access all journal articles from Smith Libraries, you will need to be logged into Smith's Virtual Private Network [(instructions on how to set this up)](https://www.smith.edu/its/tara/networking/vpn.html){target="_blank"}. 
1. Tips on reading. Take the *minimally viable product* approach. In other words, a completed imperfect reading is better than an incomplete "perfect" reading.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("static/images/MVP.png")
```

    
### 2. MP1

Ask any questions in the `#mp1` channel on Slack.

**a) Data collection**

1. To the best of your abilities, replicate my DBH data collection in the video.
1. You will submit your answers in this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJ28eWWThINaXKWE2uvOFuDL2YiMVPheSa47ZRrtp8Q10W1Q/viewform){target="_blank"}.
1. You may need help identifying the tree's species. To this end, take a few photos of the tree and if possible the leaves. 


**b) First GitHub edits**

1. Create an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/){target="_blank"}, which you can think of as a social security number for research. Mine is [0000-0001-7824-306X](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7824-306X){target="_blank"}.
1. *Clone* the following *repo* *locally* onto your computer using RStudio: my *forked* copy of Prof. Ben Baumer's [`macleich` R package](https://github.com/rudeboybert/macleish){target="_blank"}. 
1. *Pull* the repo to update it with any changes.
1. Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file by adding yourself as a contributor like I did.
1. *Commit* your changes and then *push* them.
1. You may need to check out these [notes](https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS192/PS.html#1_github_component){target="_blank"} on getting started linking GitHub to RStudio. If you have questions, please ask on Slack!
