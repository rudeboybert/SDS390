### Lecture topic 1

How to manually set interval length in a `tsibble()`. Using "time class functions" from [FPP 2.1](https://otexts.com/fpp3/tsibbles.html){target="_blank"} include:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/time_class_functions.png")
```  

```{r}
# Lec14 code
library(tsibble)
library(lubridate)

# From https://otexts.com/fpp3/tsibbles.html. Manually setting yearly data
yearly <- tsibble(
  Year = 2015:2019, 
  Observation = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110), 
  # Note this sets the increment value to [1Y]. It seems to autodetect that this
  # is yearly data:
  index = Year
)
autoplot(yearly)

# Setting daily data
daily <- tsibble(
  Day = seq(from = ymd("2020-10-01"), to = ymd("2020-10-06"), by = "1 day"),
  Value = c(76, 4, 79, 9, 11, 66),
  # Note this sets the increment value to [1D]. This is easy to detect since
  # Day is a "date" object
  index = Day
)
autoplot(daily)
```


### Lecture topic 2

Is your training data *representative* of your test data? From [Kaggle Airbnb prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings){target="_blank"}. You are interested in predicting/forecasting whether a new Airbnb user makes a booking within the first month of signing up. See this [plot](static/airbnb.pdf){target="_blank"}.


### Lecture topic 3

Approximating the overstory using the *perfect plasticity approximation*.

# Lec 09: Tue 9/29 {#Lec09}

### 1. Model selection

Recall our comparison of two models for interspecies competition from [Lec07](#Lec07). Which model should we select? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", out.height="20%", fig.cap="Two models for the effect of competitor biomass.", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("static/images/competition_1.png", "static/images/competition_2.png"))
``` 

Model selection attempts to balance (1) goodness-of-fit (how well a model fits points) and (2) model complexity. These two quantities are **inversely related**. Using example data from [ModernDive Chapter 6.3.1](https://moderndive.com/6-multiple-regression.html#model-selection){target="_blank"}, we discuss two numerical methods for selecting between (1) parallel slopes and (2) interaction regression models:

1. R-squared adjusted: $R^2_{adj} = 1 - \frac{n-1}{n - (k+1)}(1-R^2)$
1. Akaike Information Criteria: $AIC = 2k - 2\cdot\text{log-likelihood}$

# Lec 08: Thu 9/24 {#Lec08}

## Videos

### 1. R Packages

Building a minimally viable R package based on the "R Packages" book [Chapter 2: The whole game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html){target="_blank"} and a little bit of [Chapter 14: External data](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html){target="_blank"}. [PDF of chalk talk](static/chalk_talks/Lec08.pdf){target="_blank"}.

</center>
</br>

**Post-video update**: Recall from the end of the video that the reason the `check()` of the package failed was because the `man/toy_data.Rd` help file for the `toy_data` dataset did not get created. The reason is I misspelled the name of the dataset in `R/toy_data.R`:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("static/images/toy_data.png")
```

This is a great lesson in the value of running `check()` often! Fix this by:

1. Fixing the above typo
1. Running `devtools::document()` to create the `man/toy_data.Rd` help file
1. Installing the package locally using `devtools::install()`
1. Checking the package using `devtools::check()`




## Class meeting time

1. Run this code to ensure the following packages are up-to-date: `install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))`
1. Announcements:
    1. Stick with lecture start time of 9:45, but we'll keep things moving briskly.
1. Breakout rooms:
    1. Discussion on Vogue article
    1. Other questions
1. Discuss what's next week
1. [Link](https://smith.zoom.us/rec/share/18_mdQR9-Lb_Z814FUVjgdeJRc1VX8BVXbCPnmiBDCh1TDnLU_y-8lPBrDRvc4CU.QOOyscB1PNLL2k8d?startTime=1600955111000){target="_blank"} to video recording.




## For next week

### 1. Readings

1. **Allen 2020**: If you haven't already, dedicate 30 minutes for a "done is better than perfect"
reading. Even if their are gaps in understanding, just encountering the terms and ideas for the first time will prime you for the next time.
1. **FPP3**: In particular the $y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t$ seasonal + trend + remainder breakdown of the $y_t$ US retail employment time series in [Figure 3.10](https://otexts.com/fpp3/classical-decomposition.html#fig:classical-empl){target="_blank"}.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(fpp3)
us_retail_employment <- us_employment %>%
  filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == "Retail Trade") %>%
  select(-Series_ID)

# Fit decomposition model
dcmp <- us_retail_employment %>%
  model(classical_decomposition(Employed, type = "additive"))

# Plot decomposition model
components(dcmp) %>% 
  autoplot() + 
  labs(x = "Year", title = "Employed = Trend + Seasonal + Remainder")
```


### 2. MP4 {#MP4}

For MP4, you will be adding one documented function, one documented dataset, and your `DESCRIPTION` info to the [`foofactors`](https://github.com/390-2020-09-Fall/foofactors){target="_blank"} package I demoed in the video. You are going to work in the following groups:

```{r}
set.seed(76)
students <- c("Candy", "Emma S.", "Emma K.", "Haley", "Lauren", "Olivia", "Serena", "Sophie", "Starry")
tibble(
  name = sample(students),
  Branch = rep(1:3, times = 3) %>% str_c("group", .),
  member = rep(1:3, each = 3) %>% str_c("Member ", .)
) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = member, values_from = name)
```

You will

1. Each create branches from your group's branch. i.e. a branch of a branch.
1. Each independently work on your function, dataset, and `DESCRIPTION` file, being sure to `install()` and `check()` your package often. 
1. Create a pull request of your branch into the group's branch.
1. Request a *code review*: Member 1 requests a review from Member 2, 2 from 3, and 3 from 1.
1. Go back and forth about requested changes as necessary on the pull request page, just as I did for MP2. 
1. Once approved, Member 2 will merge Member 1's pull request into the group's branch.

Example: Lauren will

1. Create a branch `group1-lauren` from the `group1` branch.
1. Push/commit changes to the package to her `group1-lauren` branch, making sure to `install()` and `check()` her local version of the package often. 
1. Create a pull request of `group1-lauren` into `group1`
1. Tag Haley for a code review.
1. Incorporate changes requested by Haley (if any) 
1. Once approved, Haley will merge Lauren's pull request of the contents of the `group1-lauren` branch into the `group1` branch.


Notes:

1. Later on, we'll eventually merge the changes in the three group branches into `master`.
1. Expect [Oh shit, git!](https://wizardzines.com/zines/oh-shit-git/){target="_blank"} moments, especially *merge conflicts* in the `DESCRIPTION` file.

# Lec 07: Tue 9/22 {#Lec07}

## Videos

### 1. Filepaths

*Absolute* filepaths only work on your computer, thus making your work less reproducible. Using filepaths that are *relative* to some assumed *root* folder will work on anybody's computer. The `here` R package facilitates relative filepath use by always assuming the *root* folder is the folder of your RStudio Project.

## Videos

### 1. Maximum likelihood estimation

Say you have data that consists of the following pairs of observations: diameter at breast height (dbh) as measured by your dendroband and day of year (doy) of the measurement. How we find the "best fitting" S-shaped curve through these points? In other words, how do we find the "optimal" values of the 5 parameters from the generalized logistic function? Also, what do we even by "best fitting"? [PDF of chalk talk](static/chalk_talks/Lec06.pdf){target="_blank"}.

## For next week

### 1. Readings

1. **Allen 2020**: Dedicate 30 minutes for a "done is better than perfect"
reading **before** lecture
1. **R packages Ch2**: I suggest you follow along by running the code. You'll
need to do this eventually anyways.
1. **Vogue**: We're going to have a discussion on this article on Lec08 on Thu
9/24. This article was shared by my SCBI colleague [Erika
Gonzalez-Akre](https://sites.google.com/site/forestecoclimlab/people#h.p_ID_132){target="_blank"}

### 2. MP3 {#MP3}

Based on your MP2 work, create a Shiny app!

1. I will give feedback on MP2 via GitHub code review by tomorrow 5pm.
1. Consult
    1. The [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/){target="_blank"}
    1. Shiny cheatsheet for the kinds of inputs you can create: RStudio
menu bar -> Help -> Cheatsheets -> Web apps with Shiny -> 1st page -> Right-hand
column
1. Create a new branch of the same repo as in MP2 and create a new pull request.
1. Criteria for app? Done is better than perfect.

I can't emphasize this enough: start simple, make a small incremental change and
test that it works, then make another small incremental change and test that
that works, and so on. If you make to large a change without testing, your app
will be harder to debug.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("static/images/MVP.png")
```

**Added on Tue 9/22**:

1. Submission instructions: Here is a template GitHub repo for [MP3](https://github.com/390-2020-09-Fall/shiny_app){target="_blank"}. However, unlike MP2 where you were an internal collaborator to the repo, here we are going to assume you are not a collaborator. Hence you will "fork" your own copy of the MP3 repo.
1. Start ultra simple, even if the interactive element isn't scientifically interesting.
1. Example workflow: Test early, test often.
    1. Get a non-interactive version of your plot working. I recommend you do this in a separate file, because debugging code in a Shiny app can get messy.
    1. Copy over code for non-interactive plot into your Shiny RStudio Project `app.R` file. *Test the app. If it works, commit your changes.*
    1. Add an input panel, but don't connect `input$` value to output plot yet. *Test the app. If it works, commit your changes.*
    1. Connect `input$` value to output plot. Test the app. *Test the app. If it works, commit your changes.*
    1. If you have time, iterate through the above steps. *Test the app. If it works, commit your changes.*

## For next week

### 1. Readings

The readings for next week are posted in the above Schedule Google Sheet. Anything below the orange line is still TBD.  

1. **Albert's tips for Shiny reading**: Run the code! The best way to learn how to use tools is to learn by doing.
1. **Albert's tips for Ecological Forecasting reading**: This book is pitched at a higher level than for undergraduates. However let's keep with the "some is better than none" philosophy by dedicating at least 30 minutes to reading and *setting a timer*.
    1. Read the synopsis at the start of each chapter
    1. Read the key concepts at the back of each chapter
    1. Scan through the figures and tables
    1. Most importantly tho, look at the clock and keep moving! *Done is better than perfect!*
    1. If you have more time or are more curious, then iterate through the above steps again, again, again, ...

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("static/images/MVP.png")
```


### 2. MP2

Ask any questions in the `#mp2` channel on Slack.

**a) Race to the first data visualization** Create a first visualization of the 2018 SCBI ForestGEO census. For MP3, you'll be making a Shiny interactive version of this visualization.

1. Re-watch Lec04 Video 2 about tree censuses 
1. *"Numbers are numbers, but data has context"*: Look at map of the four corners of the [SCBI site](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1QYcZhzmRASjCqFyCiraxosBmMcWrEeg7&usp=sharing){target="_blank"}. 
1. Clone the playground version of the [SCBI-ForestGEO-Data](https://github.com/390-2020-09-Fall/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data) repo
1. Find the relevant `.csv` file in the `tree_main_census/` folder
1. Load the `.csv` in R


**b) Submit via GitHub branch and pull request**

1. Create a new branch just like in Lec04 Video 1.
1. Create your visualization in a file `390/YOURFIRSTNAME_YOURLASTNAME.Rmd`
1. Make all commits
1. Submit a pull request

## For next week

### 1. Readings

The readings for next week are posted in the above Schedule Google Sheet. Anything below the orange line is still TBD.  

1. To access all journal articles from Smith Libraries, you will need to be logged into Smith's Virtual Private Network [(instructions on how to set this up)](https://www.smith.edu/its/tara/networking/vpn.html){target="_blank"}. 
1. Tips on reading. Take the *minimally viable product* approach. In other words, a completed imperfect reading is better than an incomplete "perfect" reading.

1. *Clone* the following *repo* *locally* onto your computer using RStudio: my *forked* copy of Prof. Ben Baumer's [`macleich` R package](https://github.com/rudeboybert/macleish){target="_blank"}. 
1. *Pull* the repo to update it with any changes.
1. Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file by adding yourself as a contributor like I did.
1. *Commit* your changes and then *push* them.
1. You may need to check out these [notes](https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS192/PS.html#1_github_component){target="_blank"} on getting started linking GitHub to RStudio.
