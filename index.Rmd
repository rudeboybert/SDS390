# Lec 01: Tue 9/1

## Synchronous

1. Introductions: name, pronoun, year, major, city you're currently in, name a few things you will do this semester for self-care.
1. Announcement from the [Statistical & Data Sciences Coalition of Color (SDSCC)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1trAXeX9FHCHiMk5iFTN14TEmK8tXbRHfY5WdmNGChVc/edit#slide=id.g93874104fe_0_5){target="_blank"}
1. Go over syllabus
1. What is forecasting? From [FPP 3.5](https://otexts.com/fpp2/prediction-intervals.html){target="_blank"}:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("https://otexts.com/fpp2/fpp_files/figure-html/googforecasts2-1.png")
```
1. Discussion topic: Name four variables about a tree that both (1) are easily measurable in the field while (2) capture the most information about it.


## Asynchronous

I will post a ~20min video lecture by Wednesday afternoon eastern time. This is why we are starting synchronous discussions 25 minutes later than scheduled. 

1. "Chalk talk" on GitHub. I encourage you to not just passively watch, but also actively write. [Field Notes'](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/){target="_blank"} slogan is *I'm not writing it down to remember it later, I'm writing it down to remember it now.*
1. Data collection activity... in the field!
