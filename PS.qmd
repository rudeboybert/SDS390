## Example Solutions

1.  Presentations:
    1.  Charavee + Rachel [solutions](https://github.com/rudeboybert/SDS390/blob/master/PS/PS03_presentations/PS03_charavee_rachel.ipynb)
    2.  Kiera + Juniper [solutions](https://github.com/rudeboybert/SDS390/blob/master/PS/PS03_presentations/PS03_kiera_juniper.ipynb)
    3.  .zip file of both [here](PS/PS03_presentations.zip)
2.  Prof Kim's [solution](https://github.com/rudeboybert/SDS390/blob/master/PS/PS03_albert.ipynb). Note a couple of things I did have time to address b/c of my conference last week:
    1. I didn't polish my graphs. (An example of bad role modeling on my part: "Do as I say, not do as I do." Apologies)
    1. I realized I calculated the seasonal naive forecast wrong! Where as you were supposed to using only the prior year's worth of seasons (i.e. 4 time points each corresponding to the last four quarters), I computed the average for all past quarters! i.e. all springs, all summers, etc. And thus my solution was more complicated than necessary. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Set 2

1.  [Slides](PS/dendrobands.pdf) on PS02 data's context. Prof Kim quote: "Numbers are numbers, but data has context"
2.  My thoughts about ChatGPT. It is a very powerful tool, but you need to be:
    1.  Knowledgeable enough to understand the code
    2.  Experienced enough in your domain and programming to know what to prompt
    3.  Disciplined enough to sanity check your results

## Instructions

1.  Posted on Slack under `#general`
2.  Individual `PS02.ipynb` files
    1.  Complete `PS02.ipynb` by Tue 10/24 class time
    2.  Due Thu 10/26 9:25am on Moodle
3.  In-class on Tue 10/24: "Think, Pair, Share" exercise

Clarifications:

1.  Use the `dbh` variable, not the `dbh_orig` variable.
2.  D'oh! Say you do 5 queries on ChatGPT and then get the share URL link. Now saw you do a 6th query. The share URL does NOT reflect this 6th search. So you will need to get the share URL link AFTER you're done your PS02.

## In-Class Presentations

1.  Groups still made at random, presenters still chosen at random
2.  No need to merge two files, you can select only one person's and modify it (if at all)
3.  Reminder: submission due on Moodle before next class
4.  Answer the sli.do poll [here](https://app.sli.do/event/vdsVBebJSrnKE2mx4morQf/embed/polls/611ff80c-6e35-4148-98ad-9247d3da80f0)

    3.  I will pick 2-3 pairs at random to present their work in front of the class
    4.  You will rate your peer's preparation using this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6uHGVCgcHwBae-k00k6GXxmWKAhouNWivH-3NSim020bgww/viewform)

Clarifications added afterwards:

1.  Dataset should be at least 100 rows
2.  For mini-presentation, you will have to choose one of the two datasets
3.  Do problem set in python

## In-Class Presentations

1.  I will make groups at random using code below. I will join a group if there is an odd person left out.
2.  Work together for 20 minutes to come up with single `.ipynb`
3.  I will pick two teams at random to present to the class
4.  I will present my work to the class. click [here](https://github.com/rudeboybert/SDS390/blob/master/PS/PS01_albert.ipynb)
